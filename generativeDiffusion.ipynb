    "# Building a Generative Diffusion Model with WoW Icons\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I'll document the process of building a generative diffusion model that can create new WoW-style icons (kind of).\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses a simple DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model) approach. The model exclusively removes noise based on random input noise images, without any conditioning or optimizations. In fact, it's entirely unoptimized for running on my laptop's limited hardware, so this notebook is really a learning exercise to help me understand the fundamentals of diffusion models.\n",

    "Diffusion models work by gradually adding noise to images (forward process) and then learning to reverse this process (reverse process), allowing for high-quality image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward process is a predetermined 'Markov chain' based on a noise schedule. Whereby; \"predetermined\" means we decide in advance exactly how much noise to add at each step according to our noise schedule - it's not random but follows a specific pattern, and \"Markov chain\" means each noisy version only depends on the previous step - like a chain where each link only connects to the ones right next to it. When you combine these concepts, you can precisely calculate how noisy an image will be at any step in the process, setting the stage for a model to learn how to remove the noise that has been added.\n",

    "## Forward Diffusion Process Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward diffusion process gradually adds noise to an image over a series of timesteps. Let's break down the key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noise Schedule Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def linear_beta_schedule(timesteps, start=0.0001, end=0.02):\n",
    "    return torch.linspace(start, end, timesteps)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function creates a linear schedule for the noise variance (Î²) at each timestep:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starts with minimal noise (`start=0.0001`)\n",
    "- Gradually increases to larger noise (`end=0.02`)\n",
    "- Creates `timesteps` evenly spaced values\n",
    "- The schedule controls how quickly information is destroyed during diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Function for Batch Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_index_from_list(vals, t, x_shape):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "    return out.reshape(batch_size, *((1,) * (len(x_shape) - 1))).to(t.device)\n",

    "- Extracts specific values from a parameter tensor based on timestep indices\n",

    "## The Reverse Diffusion Process and U-Net Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "While the forward diffusion process gradually adds noise to images, the reverse diffusion process is where the magic bits happens - <br>It's how we generate new images by progressively removing noise. This is accomplished using a neural network (in our case, a U-Net) that predicts the noise component at each timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reverse Diffusion Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusion model learns to reverse the forward process by predicting the noise Îµ that was added at each timestep. The mathematical equation for the reverse process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p_\\theta$ is our model's reverse distribution\n",
    "- $\\mu_\\theta$ is the predicted mean\n",
    "- $\\Sigma_\\theta$ is the predicted variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to learn how to generate images directly (which is very hard), the neural network (U-Net) is trained on a simpler task: \"Given an image with noise at step t, can you predict what noise was added?\". Once the network is trained to predict noise accurately, we can use it to generate brand new images by starting with pure random noise and then iteratively \"removing\" the predicted noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### U-Net Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A U-Net is a specific type of neural network architecture that was originally developed for biomedical image segmentation but has become widely used across many image processing tasks, including diffusion models.\n",
    "The mechanism that makes U-Net effective for both medical image segmentation and diffusion models comes down to some key architectural properties that transfer well between these seemingly different tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Preserving spatial relationships</b>: In medical imaging, U-Net excels at identifying boundaries and structures while maintaining their spatial relationships. In diffusion models, this same ability helps preserve the underlying structure of an image while noise is being predicted or removed.\n",
    "- <b>Multi-scale feature processing</b>: Medical images often contain features at different scales (from tiny cell structures to larger organs). Similarly, noise in diffusion models affects features at multiple scales - from fine textures to broader shapes. The U-Net's downsampling/upsampling path <i>(reducing/increasing the spatial dimensions of an image or feature map.)</i> processes information at various resolutions, making it effective for both tasks.\n",
    "- <b>Context integration with precision</b>: For medical segmentation, U-Net combines broad contextual information (Is this a liver? A brain?) with precise boundaries. For diffusion, it balances understanding the overall image structure while precisely identifying noise patterns at each pixel location.\n",
    "- <b>Transformation precision</b>: Both tasks require pixel-level precision in predicting output images. Whether defining the exact boundary of a tumor or determining exactly how much noise is at each pixel location, the U-Net's architecture is designed for this precise image-to-image mapping.\n",
    "- <b>Skip connections</b>: In a U-Net, a 'skip connection' directly connects a layer in the downsampling path to its corresponding layer in the upsampling path. For example, the features from the first downsampling layer are connected to the last upsampling layer, the second downsampling layer to the second-to-last upsampling layer, and so on. Skip connections solve a fundamental problem in deep networks: a) The downsampling path is great for capturing context but loses spatial precision b) The upsampling path needs to reconstruct spatial details but starts from compressed information\n",
    "  - In medical imaging: They help preserve fine boundary details that would be lost in downsampling\n",
    "  - In diffusion models: They help the model maintain the underlying image structure while focusing on noise prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental similarity is that both tasks involve transforming one image into another while preserving important structural information - whether that's transforming a medical scan into a segmentation map or transforming a noisy image into a noise prediction (which then allows for denoising).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation uses a simplified U-Net with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A downsampling path that reduces spatial dimensions and increases feature channels\n",
    "- An upsampling path that increases spatial dimensions and decreases feature channels\n",
    "- Skip connections that concatenate features from the downsampling path to the upsampling path\n",
    "- Time embeddings that inform the network which diffusion timestep it's operating on\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical aspect of diffusion models is that the network needs to know which timestep it's denoising. We use sinusoidal position embeddings, similar to those in transformer architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SinusoidalPositionEmbeddings(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, dim):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.dim = dim\n",
    "\n",
    "    def forward(self, time):\n",
    "        device = time.device\n",
    "        half_dim = self.dim // 2\n",
    "        embeddings = math.log(10000) / (half_dim - 1)\n",
    "        embeddings = torch.exp(torch.arange(half_dim, device=device) * -embeddings)\n",
    "        embeddings = time[:, None] * embeddings[None, :]\n",
    "        embeddings = torch.cat((embeddings.sin(), embeddings.cos()), dim=-1)\n",
    "        return embeddings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These embeddings create unique representations for each timestep that the model can use to apply the appropriate amount of denoising.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Block` class forms the foundation of both the downsampling and upsampling paths:\n",

    "### Key Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- These functions implement the sampling/generation process for creating new images with our diffusion model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: Without adding `@torch.no_grad()` we quickly run out of memory, because PyTorch tracks all the previous images for gradient calculation. When you use `@torch.no_grad()` as a decorator for your sampling functions, you're telling PyTorch not to track operations for automatic differentiation (gradients).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Noise Schedule Consistency**: During the reverse process (image generation), we need to know exactly how much noise to remove at each step. For this to work properly, we need to use the same noise schedule that we used when adding noise. It's like following a recipe in reverse - you need to know the exact amounts that were added originally to remove them correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Pre-calculated Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-calculated values ensure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We're removing the right amount of noise at each step\n",
    "2. We're adding the right amount of new randomness when needed (yes, sometimes we add a small amount of new noise during generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we didn't use these pre-calculated values and instead made up new values during the reverse process, the math wouldn't work out correctly, and we'd get blurry or unrealistic images.\n"
